![Welcome to my Github!](https://github.com/RyadBenameur/RyadBenameur/assets/152438070/47635662-1ac1-4820-a003-da29caa2a1b2)


My name is **Ryad Benameur**. Online, some people know me as **BoneJangles** - a nick name I have had since I was a kid.
### 🙋‍♂️ About me!
I am a 20-*something* year old software developer, who specialises in creating programs and scripts mainly using python. I have been using **python** to program since I was in school, but I have been keeping my eye and dedicating free time to learn about other programming languages. My interests lie mainly in **game development**, so I do have interest in **C++**, but I also find **Data Analysis** and general **Web Development** fun too! But I am always looking for ways to improve my skills, so I always try something new with each project. I don't have much professional experience, so I main goal right now is to get my first job as a **Software Developer / Engineer**. I am excited to show of some of the useful programs and pages I've created on this page, as well as some of my more fun projects, as well as collabarate with as many people as possible :)
